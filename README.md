# Replicating a Diffusion Network from Scratch
This repository aims to replicate a Diffusion Network from scratch, inspired by the video tutorial titled "Coding Stable Diffusion from scratch in PyTorch" available at this link.

## Overview
Diffusion models have gained attention in the field of machine learning due to their effectiveness in generating high-quality samples and handling various tasks like image completion, denoising, and more. The video tutorial provides a comprehensive guide to implementing a Diffusion Network using PyTorch, starting from the basics.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to follow along with the tutorial, understand the concepts behind Diffusion Networks, and implement the model from scratch. By replicating the code and experimenting with it, we aim to deepen our understanding of diffusion models and their applications in machine learning.

## Repository Structure
* src/: This directory contains the source code for the Diffusion Network implementation.
* data/: Any data necessary for running the code will be stored here.
* README.md: You are reading it right now!
* requiriments.txt: Have a list of packeges with you need to install
